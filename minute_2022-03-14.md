#### 2.2. Company mission and vision

### **3. Context behind the project**
The power supply chain used by companies is very complex and the project should improve the way unforeseen problems are handled after the price has been set for a particular day.
### **4. Project Requirements**
#### 4.1. GIS showcasing assets
The application should offer a geographical representation of assets and show real time data about them.
##### Interventions:
- António asks if each user's assets are private and only visible to them, the customer replies positively.
#### 4.2. Asset creation and management
The application should allow the creation of assets which can also be managed, this includes asset repositioning, addition and removal of data fields and other adjustments.
#### 4.3. Asset connection and grid representation
A user should be able to draw the energy flow and use an asset that keeps track of all the energy being produced and consumed.
##### Interventions:
- João Costa asks if the connections should persist between sessions, the customer replies positively.
- António asks if the representation shown should correpond to physical locations, the customer replies that the more faithful the representation the better but it's up to the user to determine if the asset placement and connections make sense. 
#### 4.4. Notifications
The system should notify the user when certain fields' values cross previously defined boundaries.
#### 4.5. Dashboard with asset and market data
The user should have access to a dashboard with market data and another one with asset data. These dashboard should have graphs with real time and predicted data about several elements like the weather and market price, it should allow for comparisons to be made between values.
##### Interventions
- Flávia asks if the company can give us access to this type of data, the customer replies that the team can be provided with a substantial amount of data.
#### 4.6. Multiple markets
The previous requirements form a market and the system should support several of them.
##### Interventions
- António asks ??, the customer replies that this is handled by a regulatory entity.
- Flávia asks about the geographical scale of the project, the customer replies that depending on the company the assets can be distributed over an entire country or a smaller area.
#### 4.7. Integrating data from different sources
The system should offer a way for external applications (like AI models) to provide it with data. The customer suggests the use of an API but the team can try to come up with a better way. The data being sent to the system should be visible in the geographical representation.
#### 4.8. Hypothetical scenarios
The system should be able to function with data that isn't real, allowing for the analysis of hypothetical scenarios. The simulated assets can be copies of real assets.
##### Interventions
- Eduardo asks if the system should show real and simulated data together or separately, the customer says they should be in different markets.
- António asks if the real data should continue to be updated when showing simulated data, the customer says the team can do that, should they choose to, but it can cause problems in the dashboard.
- António asks when the data should be synchronized in simulated scenarios, the customer replies ??
### **5. Contact information and general questions**
The team and the customer exchange contact information. The customer invites the team to visit the company's headquarters on 21/03/2022 and talk with Shell employees. The team should define an MVP until then to request validation.
